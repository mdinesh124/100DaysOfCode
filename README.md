# 100DaysOfCode

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a self-directed commitment by developers to build strong and consistent coding habits. The challenge uses social accountability, transparency, and deep reflection to form healthy developer habits.

The challenge follows one simple rule:

- Code for a minimum of one hour each day for the next 100 days.

Many participants in the challenge also follow a second rule, although not required, to help build camaraderie and community:

- Each day, reach out to at least two people who are also doing the challenge.
